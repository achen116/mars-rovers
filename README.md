# Mars Rovers Image Browser
This project uses [NASA's Open APIs](https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#MarsPhotos) to create an image browser to load photos from the three different Mars Rovers. The image browser includes a left sidebar to allow navigation between the different rovers and a date filter to view past photos.

When the image browser is loaded, it defaults to photos from the Curiosity Rover for the current date.

## Steps to view project
